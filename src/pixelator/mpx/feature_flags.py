"""Module relating to pixelator feature flags.

A feature flags optionally turns on features in pixelator that are not
yet ready for production. This is useful for testing and development work.

To use a feature flag in the code you can use the following pattern:

```
from pixelator.feature_flags import MY_FEATURE_FLAG

if MY_FEATURE_FLAG:
    # Do something
    ...

```

The value of the feature flag is determined by an environment variable,
which should have the name `PIXELATOR_<NAME_OF_FLAG>`.
