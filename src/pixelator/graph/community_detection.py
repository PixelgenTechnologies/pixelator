    """Retrieve all connected components from an edgelist.

    This function takes as input an edge list pd.Dataframe (csv) that has
    been generated with `pixelator collapse`. The function filters the
    edge list by count (`min_count`) and then adds a column to the edge list
    with the respective connected components ids obtained from the graph. The
    column is named "component". The edge list is then processed to recover
    big components (technical multiplets) into smaller components if only if
    `multiplet_recovery` is True. The recovery is done using community
    detection to detect and remove problematic edges using the Leiden [1]_ community
    detection algorithm. Information about the recovered components is written
    to a CSV file (recovered_components.csv) and the edge list containing only
    the removed edge is written to a CSV file (removed_edges.csv.gz).

    The following files are generated:

    - raw edge list (csv) updated with components membership
    - edge list (csv) after multiplets recovery (if any)
    - metrics (json) with information
