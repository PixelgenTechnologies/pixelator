## Types of Contributions

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator/issues

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Fix Bugs

Look through the Github issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help
wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Implement Features

Look through the Github issues for features. Anything tagged with "feature", "improvement",
"enhancement" and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Any new feature is tagged with "feature" and "improvement" if it is already implemented and
looking for improvements, but if the feature doesn't exist, we will tag it with "feature" and
"enhancement".

### Write Documentation

Pixelator could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official Pixelator docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator/issues

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
